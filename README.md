react-native-sfsafariviewcontroller
=======================
An SFSafariViewController wrapper for React Native presenting Safari View in a modal (contrary to slide-in navigation item).

## Installation

1. Run `npm install react-native-sfsafariviewcontroller --save` in your project directory.
- Make sure you have the `UIKit` framework included in your XCode project
- Open your project in XCode, right click on `Libraries` and click `Add Files to "Your Project Name"`
- Inside your node_modules, find react-native-sfsafariviewcontroller and add `RCTSFSafariViewController.xcodeproj` to your project.
- Add `libRCTFSafariViewController.m.a` to `Build Phases -> Link Binary With Libraries`
- Whenever you want to use it within your React code - `import RCTSFSafariViewController from 'react-native-sfsafariviewcontroller'`

## Usage

```
// at the top of your file near the other imports
import RCTSFSafariViewController from 'react-native-sfsafariviewcontroller';

...

// wherever you want to trigger a browser modal appearing
RCTSFSafariViewController.open('https://google.com/');

// or with custom options
RCTSFSafariViewController.open('https://google.com/', {
  tintColor: '#90c3d4',
});

// Close the browser modal from your React Native code if needed
RCTSFSafariViewController.close();

```

## Events

```
// onLoad (when the modal has fully appeared)
RCTSFSafariViewController.addEventListener('onLoad', () => console.log('RCTSafariViewController is now visible!'));

// onDismiss (when the user has tapped on 'Done')
RCTSFSafariViewController.addEventListener('onDismiss', () => console.log('RCTSafariViewController will now disappear'));

// remove listeners once you don't need them anymore
RCTSFSafariViewController.removeEventListener('onLoad',    this.someLoadListenerReference);
RCTSFSafariViewController.removeEventListener('onDismiss', this.someDismissListenerReference);

// alternative approach
const subscription = RCTSFSafariViewController.addEventListener('onLoad', () => console.log('RCTSafariViewController is now visible!'));
subscription.remove();

```
